I left the odin project a while ago to go search more resources to help learn javascript. 

I felt and though it was a good time to come back and give it a try again. 

I spent around 8 hours in my day trying to make the grid appear and adding the color black to it.

The next day and finished it up by adding the buttons.



In the project and learned how to set a function to another variable and pass it to a parameter. 

One of the things I needed more help with was how to clear the board. It look some time to get used to but it made sense once I searched how to clear on google


I googled every step on this project and although I didnt have anything memorised how to do things, it made my learn to google a better way and search documentation and overstack flow
